MORTAL VESSEL
==============

OVERVIEW
--------
Mortal Vessel is a top-down 2D roguelike action-RPG set on the chaotic, fungi-infested planet Mykor-Hizah. Play as a mysterious sword - the soul of an amnesiac god - that possesses mortal vessels to navigate the dangerous Fungi Forests and uncover your forgotten past.

"Are you nervous [Vessel]? Your hands are cold."

GAME FEATURES
-------------
* Unique Player Experience: You are the weapon, not the wielder. Control mortal vessels to battle through the wilderness.
* Roguelike Progression: If your vessel survives a forest run, they keep all earned ZodiYuk upgrades permanently. If they die, all XP and ZodiYuks are lost.
* Camp Management: Manage your vessels at camp, ensuring they heal from injuries, train, eat, and receive proper mental health care.
* Vessel System: Vessels age as in-game time passes, eventually retiring from battle at 55 and passing away at 69.
* Profession System: Assign different professions to your vessels (Medic, Mycologist, Athlete, etc.) to operate camp buildings.
* Cosmana Skills: Develop powerful abilities like Earth Breathing, Fire Breathing, Lightning Breathing, and Ice Breathing.
