# Mortal Vessel

## Overview
Mortal Vessel is a top-down 2D roguelike action-RPG set on the chaotic, fungi-infested planet Mykor-Hizah. Play as a mysterious sword - the soul of an amnesiac god - that possesses mortal vessels to navigate the dangerous Fungi Forests and uncover your forgotten past.

## Game Features

- **Unique Player Experience**: You are the weapon, not the wielder. Control mortal vessels to battle through the wilderness.
- **Roguelike Progression**: If your vessel survives a forest run, they keep all earned ZodiYuk upgrades permanently. If they die, all XP and ZodiYuks are lost.
- **Camp Management**: Manage your vessels at camp, ensuring they heal from injuries, train, eat, and receive proper mental health care.
- **Vessel System**: Vessels age as in-game time passes, eventually retiring from battle at 55 and passing away at 69.
- **Profession System**: Assign different professions to your vessels (Medic, Mycologist, Athlete, etc.) to operate camp buildings.
- **Cosmana Skills**: Develop powerful abilities like Earth Breathing, Fire Breathing, Lightning Breathing, and Ice Breathing.
